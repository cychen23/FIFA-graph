# FIFA-graph

This is the code used to make an interactive, dynamic graph detailing various data about past FIFA world cups. It is the result of a CS class homework assignment. They provided the folder organization/templates and data. I wrote the code to create the graphs, essentially everything after line 23 in main.js
